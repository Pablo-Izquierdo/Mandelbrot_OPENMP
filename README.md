# Mandelbrot_OPENMP

At this proyect, not only do I create a manderbrot parallel implementation with OPENMP, but also i have use profiling tools and the debbuger to find the slowerst parts of the code.

In addition to the OPENMP parallel implementation, I have implemented the mandelbrot code with OPENMP with private variables, and also with runtime functions, and compared them.
